Undetected CS2 Software

- `Expectional` The name of this project
- `Open Source` This application is open source and for everyone to learn from
- `External` We do not inject any DLLs into the target process
- `Read Only` We do not write to the CS2 process in any way, so VAC can't detect it
- `kernel` We do not use any user level WinAPIs in order to get information from the CS2 process

# Features
Expectional is read only software so we cant use some features like "Skinchanger" now look at our features:

 - ESP
   5 Types:
   - Box ESP (box and corner)
   - Skeleton ESP (bones)
   - Armor ESP (bar)
   - Health ESP (bar and text)
   - Snapline ESP (line)

   - Aimbot
     Uses Mouse Event so moves ur mouse for lock at enemy but a little bit buggy cuz not checking distance only locks...
